            <p class="first_line_1">Somebody said that it couldn’t be done,</p>
            <p>But he with a chuckle replied</p>
            <p>That “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be one</p>
            <p>Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.</p>
            <p>So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin</p>
            <p>On his face. If he worried he hid it.</p>
            <p>He started to sing as he tackled the thing</p>
            <p>That couldn’t be done, and <span class="callout_1">he did it.</span></p>

            <p class="first_line_2">Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you’ll never do that;</p>
            <p>At least no one ever has done it”;</p>
            <p>But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,</p>
            <p>And the first thing we knew he’d begun it.</p>
            <p>With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,</p>
            <p>Without any doubting or quiddit,</p>
            <p>He started to sing as he tackled the thing</p>
            <p>That couldn’t be done, and <span class="callout_2">he did it.</span></p>

            <p class="first_line_3">There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,</p>
            <p>There are thousands to prophesy failure;</p>
            <p>There are thousands to point out to you one by one,</p>
            <p>The dangers that wait to assail you.</p>
            <p>But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,</p>
            <p>Just take off your coat and go to it;</p>
            <p>Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing</p>
            <p>That “cannot be done,” and <span class="callout_3">you’ll do it.</span></p>
