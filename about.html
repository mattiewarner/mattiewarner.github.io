                    Hi, I’m Mattie. Where do I begin, first off I call myself a “utility player graphic designer.” I am passionate about layout design and social media and am always willing to learn new techniques with a wide variety of skills. I have a BFA in Graphic Design and a minor in Advertising from Kansas State University. I am an Adventurer personality type. Being spontaneous, setting goals, taking occasional risks, and having some fun is my ideal workplace.
